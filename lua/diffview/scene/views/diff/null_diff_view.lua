---`NullDiffView` is the shared base for diff views that don't query a VCS:
---the file list is static, every buffer source comes from disk (via
---`RevType.LOCAL` for editable sides or `RevType.CUSTOM` + a `get_data`
---reader for read-only ones), and the adapter is a `NullAdapter`. The
---concrete subclasses (`FileDiffView`, `FileMergeView`, `FileDirDiffView`)
---only differ in how they shape the initial `FileEntry` list inside their
---own `init`; the rest of the lifecycle is consolidated here.
---
---Subclasses are expected to:
---  * Call `NullDiffView.init(self, opt)` with the standard `DiffView` opts (no rev arg,
---    no path args, an adapter that's a `NullAdapter`).
---  * Populate `self.files` (working / conflicting / staged buckets) before
---    returning from `init`. `post_open` reads the panel's ordered file
---    list and focuses the first entry.
---  * Override `init_layout` only if they need the file panel visible. The
---    default hides the panel (a one-entry view has nothing useful to show
---    there); `FileDirDiffView` overrides to keep it because its list has
---    N entries.

---    expect to exist (even though there's no commit log for these views).
